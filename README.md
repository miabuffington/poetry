Code for generating random poetry
My goal for this project was to incorporate "House of Dust" into a piece of literature that I really admire. I thought that "Through the Looking Glass" is super poetic on its own, and has many short sentences that create intrigue and sound intrinsically artistic. I also think that contrasted with my more random poem, it created a neat result. My randomized poetry has some pretty odd words, and when you read through the initial poetry and reach the imported text, it creates a fun juxtaposition.
